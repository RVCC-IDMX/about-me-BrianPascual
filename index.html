<h2>Biography</h2>
 

<div>
<p>Hi, I'm Brian Pascual. I'm a student at Raritan Valley Community College (RVCC), and I am studying Information Technology. This is my first semester in college as an English learner, after completing the ESL (English as a Second Language) program to improve my communication skills. I was born in the United States but lived in Mexico for many years, which is why I speak Spanish fluently and bring a multicultural perspective to everything I do.</p>
<p>I have always been passionate about technology and how it shapes our world. I enjoy problem-solving and learning how systems work, which is why IT feels like the right path for me. Math has also been one of my favorite subjects for as long as I can remember—it’s like solving puzzles, and I enjoy the logic behind it.</p>
<p>I consider myself a quiet and observant person. While some people may assume I am antisocial at first, I am just someone who takes time to open up. Once I do, I enjoy connecting with others and learning from different perspectives.</p>

<h2> My Hobbies</h2>
<div>
<p>Outside of classes, I have a wide range of interests. I love playing video games—they help me relax and sometimes even challenge my critical thinking. I also enjoy fishing, playing volleyball, and spending time outdoors. Gardening is another hobby I like; I know how to grow plants and find it rewarding to care for them.</p>
<p>In addition, I enjoy taking pictures, especially of nature and everyday moments that tell a story. Photography allows me to be creative and see the world from different angles. I also like cooking—trying new recipes or preparing simple meals helps me unwind and express myself in the kitchen.</p>
<p>These hobbies help me stay balanced and express myself in different ways, both socially and creatively.

<h2>Fear or Future: How Society Should Approach Artificial intelligence</h2>

<div>

<p>The exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) over the years has been amazing. Almost all technologies use AI, such as our phones and computers. AI has generated debate around the world. Is AI a revolutionary tool that can help society, or a dangerous entity that will replace human jobs and autonomy? New technology machines have become more intelligent, more people are concerned about job displacement, control over AI, and ethical management, which have increased through the years. However, these fears are often based on misconceptions that people have been influenced by TV, News, or the Internet about AI’s nature because humans do not understand new technologies and think it is dangerous. By creating consciousness, AI should be accepted as a tool that will help society and not as a threat.</p>

<h3>AI and the Myth of Autonomy</h3>
<p>One of the most common fears about AI is that it will become autonomous and start making decisions without human intervention. In The Saturday Debate: Should We Fear Artificial Intelligence?” Bill Bishop says that AI may evolve from being useful to becoming mandatory, claiming that it will soon begin to tell us what to do. This is partially right because these days AI is part of our lives, and I am certain that it will become an essential tool in the future, but I don’t think that it will tell us what to do because AI is a machine created and programmed by humans and people do not have to fear AI. However, fear is based on a misunderstanding. Isaac Schick, in his article “There is no reason to Fear Artificial Intelligence, counters Bishop’s opinion by explaining that AI does not think for itself, but mimics human patterns based on its software programming. He mentions, "ChatGPT and other AI-type models... do not think independently but instead copy patterns." Similarly, IBM shows that AI we know is narrow AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks, and cannot be considered a conscious machine (IBM). These ideas make it clear that AI is not a conscious threat, but a tool designed with human involvement.</p>

<h3>Job Displacement vs. Job Transformation</h3>
<p>Another enormous concern is that AI will cause mass unemployment. Bishop argues that companies will find AI more efficient and cheaper than human workers, making people “a waste of money.” This concern is highlighted by Gillian Hadfield, who agrees that AI may automate some jobs. However, Schick responds by saying, “Holding off technological progress to preserve jobs is unrealistic.” He explains that technological revolutions have always caused job changes, but not job extinction. Supporting this view, Anthony Goldbloom in his TED talk, “The jobs we’ll lose to machines-and the ones we won’t,” explains that while AI will take care of our routine tasks, jobs that require creativity and critical-strategic thinking are here to stay. Goldbloom affirms, “Humans and machines are good at different things,” reinforcing the idea that AI will complement human work rather than replace it.</p>

<h3>The Role of Regulation</h3>
<p>Smart regulation is essential to control AI’s potential while minimizing its risks. Hadfield proposes the development of regulatory. Hadfield suggests the development of regulatory technologies to ensure AI systems are safe and reliable. She writes, “The secret to a future where we don’t fear AI is being bold about new ideas for regulating AI” (Hadfield). Meanwhile, Shick warns against overregulation based on misunderstanding because nothing that excessive fear can slow progress. A good strategy is necessary, for example, one that protects society but allows innovation to succeed. By educating people and legislators about AI’s capabilities and limitations, we can create laws that advance growth while protecting against abuse.</p>

<h3>Misunderstanding AI: A Psychological Barrier</h3>
<p>Much of the fear about AI is based on mental responses to new and unfamiliar technologies. Schick points out that society often views AI as self-conscious intelligence due to the media, such as movies, which distorts people's perception. He cites tests showing AI’s inability to understand jokes or emotions as proof that AI is not thinking like a human being. This concords with IBM’s definition of AI as a pattern-recognition tool rather than an independent mind. Society can overcome irrational fears and approach AI with a clearer, more rational mindset by promoting accurate information and digital literacy.</p>

<h3>Addressing the Skepticism</h3>
<p>Critics like bishop see a future dominated by AI, where human freedom is lost. But this vision depends on the damaged assumption that AI will evolve into an essential, autonomous being. Understanding that AI cannot act beyond its programming, we dismantle the base of that fear.  As Goldbloom and Schick show, AI is a tool, not an evil machine. With proper supervision and realistic expectations, AI can empower rather than overcome them.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>The future of artificial intelligence is complex. It is affected by how we choose to understand and use it. While fears about job loss, autonomy, and regulation are important to consider, they should not prevent society from accepting the potential of AI. With informed people's talk, balanced control, and a compromise to innovation, AI can be a force for good. The choice lies not in fearing the future, but in preparing for it responsibly.</p>
