## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

Hi, I am **Brian Pascual**, and this is my personal "About Me" webpage developed as a part of my journey in mastering web development. The goal was to explore and apply fundamental front-end development skills including HTML and CSS.

The project is structured around showcasing who I am, what I like, and how others can contact me. Through the different sections of the site, I learndes how to:

- **HTML**: Structure semenatic content, use elemnets like sections, articles, forms appropiately, and add link external assets.
- **CSS**: Buld responsive layouts using Flexbox, apply transitions, add hover, and customize a professional and clean design.

## ðŸŽ¨ Color Scheme

The design choices reflect a clean, modern, and personal aesthetic. Below are the primary colors used throughout the project:

| Color Name       | Preview  |
|------------------|----------|
| Light Purple     | #B23EDE|
| Black            | #322C34|
| Slate Gray       | #585E4A|
| Light Green      | #cfff60|
| White            | #F8F8FF| 


These colors were chosen for their contrast, readability, and subtle vibrance. The overall scheme aims to strike a balance between professional and personal.

## ðŸ“š Citations

While the majority of content, layout, and imagery was created or captured by me, the following resources and references were used:

- **Fonts**: Google Fonts â€“ [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
- **Images**: All images used are my personal photography or artwork, except:
  - Background textures and icons (if any) are from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

If I integrate additional assets later, this section will be updated accordingly.
