## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

Hi, I am **Brian Pascual**, and this is my personal "About Me" webpage developed as a part of my journey in mastering web development. The goal was to explore and apply fundamental front-end development skills including HTML and CSS.

The project is structured around showcasing who I am, what I like, and how others can contact me. Through the different sections of the site, I learndes how to:

- **HTML**: Structure semenatic content, use elemnets like sections, articles, forms appropiately, and add link external assets.
- **CSS**: Buld responsive layouts using Flexbox, apply transitions, add hover, and customize a professional and clean design.

## ðŸŽ¨ Color Scheme

The design choices reflect a clean, modern, and personal aesthetic. Below are the primary colors used throughout the project:

| Color Name       | Preview  |
|------------------|----------|
| Green            |rgb(88, 230, 49)|
| Black            |rgb(0, 0, 0)|
| Slate Gray       | #585E4A|
| Blue             |rgb(62, 47, 231)|
| White            |rgb(253, 253, 253)| 


These colors were chosen for their contrast, readability, and subtle vibrance. The overall scheme aims to strike a balance between professional and personal.
